        <h4>Nature and purpose of processing</h4>
        <p>When you access our website, i.e. if you do not register or otherwise transmit information, information of a general nature is automatically collected. This information (server log files) includes, for example, the type of web browser, the operating system used, the domain name of your Internet service provider, your IP address and similar information.</p>
        <p>They are processed for the following purposes in particular:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>for the technically error-free display and optimisation of the website</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not use your data to draw conclusions about your person. However, we reserve the right to subsequently check the server log files if there are concrete indications of unlawful use.</p>
        <h4>Legal basis and legitimate interest</h4>
        <p>Processing is carried out in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR on the basis of our legitimate interest in improving the stability and functionality of our website as well as ensuring system security and detecting misuse.</p>

        <h4>Storage duration</h4>
        <p>Data is stored in server log files in a form that enables the identification of the data subjects for a maximum of 7 days, unless a security-relevant event occurs (e.g. a DDoS attack).</p>
        <p>In the event of such an incident, server log files are stored until the security-relevant incident has been eliminated and fully clarified.</p>
        <h4>Provision prescribed or required</h4>
        <p>The provision of the aforementioned personal data is neither legally nor contractually required. However, without the IP address, the service and functionality of our website cannot be guaranteed. In addition, individual services may not be available or may be restricted.</p>
